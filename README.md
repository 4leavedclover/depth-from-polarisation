# Linear depth estimation from an uncalibrated, monocular polarisation image

This is a Matlab implementation of our ECCV 2016 paper "Linear depth estimation from an uncalibrated, monocular polarisation image". It also includes an implementation of polarimetric image decomposition (linear and nonlinear optimisation), two comparison shape-from-polarisation methods, a simple least squares surface integration method (with foreground mask) and a basic method for pixel-wise specular labelling.

Note: I am in the process of cleaning up the code and adding to the repository. I will update the list of what has been uploaded as I go along. Content included so far:

1. Comparison methods
2. Least squares integrator
3. ... check back soon for more!

I will add documentation and demo scripts once I have uploaded all of the code.
