# Linear depth estimation from an uncalibrated, monocular polarisation image

This is a Matlab implementation of our ECCV 2016 paper "Linear depth estimation from an uncalibrated, monocular polarisation image". It also includes an implementation of polarimetric image decomposition (linear and nonlinear optimisation), two comparison shape-from-polarisation methods, a simple least squares surface integration method (with foreground mask) and a basic method for pixel-wise specular labelling.
